			<p>After its construction in 1918, the Broadway building's early beginnings were as a candy store and then as the Yocom photography studio and the Haertling Art Gallery before becoming home to restaurants Yocom's Studio Restaurant, First Wok and La Estrellita, which closed in 2001.From 2002 to 2006, three different restaurants and bars -- The Library Pub, 32 Degrees and Rising, and Alexander's and Levorio's Creekside Café -- came and went from the building. The building was gutted in 2006.</p>

		<section class="description not-pink fL cf">
			<p>Coworkers seem to prefer working closer to their homes. Nearly two-thirds of the members commute 20 minutes or less to get to their space, and one in four take just ten minutes.</p>
			<p>They make these quick journeys using public transport (34%) or car (34%). Many ride bicycles (17%) or just walk (14%). The selection of transport differs widely from country to country, and town to town. The densely populated cities of Europe, with their established public transport infrastructure, are different from the suburbs of most US cities, where it is impossible to get around without a car.</p>

			<p>The majority of coworking spaces hold two events each month (21%). These may be workshops, meet-ups, breakfasts, professional classes or conferences. As the graph shows (see left), about 15% of coworking spaces host 10 or more events per month; this skews the average out to 4.5.</p>
			<p>There are good reasons for spaces to host events, not least because coworkers demand them, and attend them. 84% of all responding coworkers said they attend events, and on average they visit 1.8 events per month. These statistics reveal a small correlation: bigger coworking spaces (those with 50 or more desks) that host more regular events have a higher attendance rate for each event. The more events you host, the more often your coworkers will come to them!</p>
			<p>Boulder has more than 30 art galleries and has been recognized as one of the nation’s top cities for art by American Style magazine. The city is also home to four museums, 32 movie and stage theaters, and an impressive variety of cultural performances and events.</p>
			<p>18% of coworkers would like to have more input into the events program.</p>

			<p>Most coworkers said they had met 3.6 useful new acquaintences in the past two months.</p>
			<p>The best advertisement for a coworking space is an active coworker. Just over a third of respondents (37%) said they talk about coworking to a wider audience, via friends and social networks.</p>
			<p>Sixty percent of all survey respondents drop in to their spaces at least three to four times a week. A third work every day. The majority (47%) have 24-hour access, while just over a third utilize traditional office hours. Only one out of ten members pay by the day or the week – the majority are on monthly plans.</p>
			<p>Despite working so regularly, two out of three members use flexible desks that they vacate at the end of each day. A quarter have permanent desks that only they can occupy.</p>
			<p>The average coworker is still 34 years old, and two thirds of them are men – a finding that matches with the First Global Coworking Survey. However, one year later, we find that spaces are attracting more younger and older people. Every twelfth coworker today is over fifty.</p>
			<p>Three out of four coworking space members have a university degree as their minimum qualification. This level of education is extremely high compared to the average population in the surveyed countries. A third of all coworkers report earning above-average wages, when compared to their country’s average income level. 38% of respondents suggested that working in a coworking space directly improved their income – only 2.5% believed their income had decreased since joining.</p>
			<p>Two out of three members never worked in another coworking space before they joined their present location, the survey results show. Only one in eight respondents had been a member of two spaces, and about the same percentage tested out three or more of them. On average, coworkers have tried out 1.5 coworking spaces.</p>
			<p>The ideal coworking space would offer 24-hour access, have an even number of flexible and permanent desks, and would involve members in decisions about the interior design. That’s the picture drawn by the 2nd Global Coworking Survey, which asked coworkers what they want from their workspace. The good news – spaces are doing a great job, with an average rating of 8.4 out of 10. The bad news – they’re too noisy for a quarter of coworkers. However, the other good news is that decibels do not impact a coworking space's popularity: members do not leave their space on account of loudness.</p>
			<p>The average coworking space is 1.5 years old, and hosts around 38 members across 44 desks. Last year, the average capacity was 38. The average desk occupancy rate is 108%. Large spaces have even higher occupancy rates – those with 100 desks or more hit 172% on average. There’s a few reasons for this. Not all their members work at the same time, they offer a high proportion of flexible desks, and they are open 24 hours a day, which distributes the demand and allows higher desk utilization.</p>
			<p>By contrast, smaller spaces have a particularly high proportion of fixed desks for their members and are more likely to operate during traditional business hours. Desks utilization is restricted, so the occupancy rate rarely exceeds 100%.</p>
			<p>Most important for coworkers is interaction with other people (84%). A space should provide flexible working hours (according to 83% of respondents), and encourage serendipitous discoveries (82%).</p>
			<p>One half are happy working mostly alone (53%), and the other half in spontaneous, changing or fixed teams.</p>
			<p>Members want it both ways, a mix of open and closed spaces (40%), or open spaces with some private areas (35%).</p>
			<p>51% prefer to sit in rooms with less than 20 other people. The affection decreases with size. However, it’s rare for all desks to be occupied at all times, which gives big spaces some leeway. The size of a coworking space is unimportant to one-fifth of all respondents, so there are users for spaces of all sizes.</p>
			<p>One in two members access their workspace around the clock. Only 30% like to work during traditional business hours (9am to 5pm, or 10am to 6pm in most countries). It’s interesting to note the difference between the desired access times and the actual current access – 38% use business hours (meaning there’s a slight demand on more flexible plans). Half-day access is rare, and one in ten members have a limited number of days per month. The monthly 24-7 plan is emerging as the coworking industry standard.</p>
			<p>Some would like to have more input into the events program (18%) and opening times (13%)</p>
			<p>Office infrastructure and kitchen and food are also high on the list (23% each).</p>
			<p>We asked coworkers what they like least about their workspace. About one in four coworkers are annoyed by the level of noise in their coworking space. 14% bemoan the lack of privacy or the inadequacy of the office infrastructure. Only 8% said the prices were too high, and 3% said the other people in their space were annoying. However, a third of all respondents had no complaints whatever, and 53% only one.</p>
			<p>80% of coworkers like the other members of their space, and 61% like the location. Space operators are next in line for praise (53%), followed by reasonable prices (47%)</p>
			<p>Entrepreneurs, of which 92% feel more self-confident since joining a coworking facility. The same percentage enjoy the interrupted isolation. This group benefits the most from more relaxed evenings at home and the ability to keep their knowledge up to date.</p>
			<p>One in three entrepreneurs will expand their payroll, in which case they will then belong to the "business with other employees" category. Whether more staff are hired or not, though, entrepreneurs often collaborate with freelancers.</p>
			<p>Entrepreneurs find the potential for interdisciplinary work more important than the other groups, and are willing to pay slightly more for a desk.</p>

		<section class="description not-pink fL cf">
			<p>83% of spaces said they had exchanges with other coworking spaces on a regional or local level; only 10% keep themselves isolated. There is also a healthy level of exchange on a national level. Bigger spaces – those with 30 and more members – are more interactive on all levels, as are the longer-established spaces, those aged over 12 months.</p>
			<p>The biggest competition to coworking spaces is the home office, not the WiFi coffee shop – and not even other coworking spaces.</p>
			<p>The data shows that without fellow coworking spaces in the area, new solo spaces suffer even greater losses.</p>
			<p>Having more spaces nearby doesn’t reduce profitability. In fact, the more spaces that exist in one area, the more profitable each space becomes, and the faster they reach the break-even point.</p>
