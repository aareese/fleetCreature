			<p>Welcome to my playground,</p>
			<p>The new world of design is not about a fixed & stagnant product that you make once & have on a hard drive somewhere to occasionally print out. It is about creating in a world that is alive, flexible & constantly changing. It is about leveraging the power of technology to make something that lives outside of our computers, that touches the lives of thousands or even millions. This cover letter is not written in Word or Pages (coffins for information). This cover letter is written in code & hosted in the cloud. Today, 1.4 billion people could read these words if they looked in the right place. This is where information lives & grows. This is where everything is connected. This is where aspiring UI/UX designers need to learn to work & play & produce.</p> 
			<p>When I hire new designers I look not at their proven UI/UX skills but at their creative potential & passion. The world of web & apps evolves so quickly that it's not about what you know, but how inspired you are to make learning a lifelong pursuit.</p>
			<p>I have an intrinsic love of teaching people & need to help others achieve their potential. A huge reason I started fleetCreature was because I knew I could make a bridge between the lack of skilled UI/UX designers in the industry & the high number of people I met who could become excellent web & app designers if only they had the right education & mentorship.</p>
			<p>I'm excited to see that you are offering this course & feel that it's very much needed. It will be entirely crucial that you teach not only the right skills set but the right mind set to prepare people for the demands of being able to design in the fluctuating, evolving world of the tech ecosystem. I can offer to students a realistic education from someone in the daily trenchs of app & web design. In the past 3 years I've worked on products for over 25 companies & had up to 13 people working under me.</p>
			<p>Our motto at fleetCreature is We Make Apps The Make Life Better. Technology can either make life simpler or give you more headaches & design has a huge impact on tipping that balance. I want to help educate a generation of designers who have the skills & confidence to solve problems & make life a little more beautiful for the thousands or even millions of people they will end up effecting with their designs.</p>
			<p>Never stop making,</p>
			<p>Alyssa</p>
