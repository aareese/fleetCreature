				<h4>fC Manifesto</h4>

		<section class="description not-pink fL cf">
			<p>Welcome to our playground,</p>
			<p>The new world of design is not about a fixed & stagnant product that you make once & have on a hard drive somewhere to occasionally print out. It is about creating in a world that is alive, flexible & constantly changing. It is about leveraging the power of technology to make something that lives outside of our computers, that touches the lives of thousands or even millions. This is not written in Word or Pages (coffins for information). This manifesto is written in code & hosted in the cloud. Today, 1.4 billion people and counting could read these words if they looked in the right place. This is where information lives & grows. This is where everything is connected. This is where aspiring UI/UX designers need to learn to work & play & produce.</p> 
			<p>When we hire new designers we look not at their proven UI/UX skills but at their creative potential & passion. The world of web & apps evolves so quickly that it's not about what you know, but how inspired you are to make learning a lifelong pursuit.</p>
			<p>At fleetCreature, we have an intrinsic love of teaching people & need to help others achieve their potential. Whether you are a client hiring us or a designer working with us, you will gain new knowledge about yourself & technology as well as a deeper feeling of empowerment & direction to steer through what can feel like a chaotic world.</p>
			<p>Our motto at fleetCreature is <span class = "emphasis">We Make Life Better By Design</span>. Technology can either make life simpler or give the world more headaches & design has a huge impact on tipping that balance. fleetCreature is about innovative thinkers who have the skills & confidence to solve problems & make life a little more beautiful for the thousands or even millions of people we will end up affecting with our designs.</p>
			<p>Never stop making,</p>
			<p>Alyssa Reese  |  Founder</p>
