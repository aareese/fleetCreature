				<h3>To Serve the Coffee Culture and Market Opportunity</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<section class="description not-pink fL cf">
			<p>Coffee has become a huge part of the American lifestyle ($12 billion in annual sales), and yet no platform currently exists that captures and encourages the emotionality behind this experience. This app allows coffee lovers to express themselves around their coffee experiences, discover their preferences, and explore this part of their world. The competition (Yelp, Facebook, Google Places) provides an overly reductive rating system that ignores the complexity and particularities that are so central to coffee lovers’ experiences. It also doesn’t allow for coffee shop owners to capture the soul of their stories and form personal connections with their patrons.</p>
		</section>
		<div class="bullets span-2 fL cf">
			<p>COMPETITION</p>
			<ul class="deliverables">
				<li>Yelp - Single rating system, no way to group user feedback into a manageable, readable way</li>
				<li>Google Places - Focuses primarily on location, single rating system</li>
				<li>Facebook - Poor search function</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="bullets span-2 last fR cf">
			<p>ROLE MODELS</p>
				<ul class="deliverables">
					<li>Air B&B - Nice design, difficult for users to tell a bad story</li>

				<h3>The platform for drinkers, vendors, & owners</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<section class="description not-pink fL cf">
			<p>A platform in which patrons, owners, and vendors create rich profiles to connect around shared values and stories. Establishments are rated across a detailed list of factors, from machinery used to products available to ambience and service style. Coffee shop profiles are built along “storylines,” fields which serve as prompts for key story elements (e.g. founder’s story, trials and tribulations, vision). user profiles serve as a way for coffee lovers to claim their idiosyncratic preferences, express their loyalties (and rivalries), and search for new coffee shops anywhere in the world based on their detailed preferences. These functionalities will allow coffee lovers to go beyond the search and connect with coffee shops that fit their unique style, similar to online dating platforms.</p>
