			<p><span class = "darkText">WHAT</span> A comprehensive exploration of your product from Business to Users to Branding to UI/UX to Platforms and beyond with fleetCreature's team of experts that has worked with dozens of Tech Startups and has exhaustive experience with what works, what doesn't & where to draw the lines.</p>
			<p><span class = "darkText">WHY</span> Why Deep Dive? Bottom line, to save money. Tech products are expensive, averaging anywhere from 50K to several million dollars. Without a well planned & thought out foundation created with a team of people experienced in making tech products, a business can easily waste thousands & thousands of dollars going down the wrong path or worse, never end up with a product that achieves their goals. The Deep Dive helps insure that you don't build your fortress on the sand.</p>
