			<p>What is the magic of this building? It overpowers you with green trees, flowing water, a sense of calm, a feeling of home. More than that though, the building effuses history & authenticity: it is not what it's trying to be but what it already is that everyone falls in love with. The most authentic name we can give it is it's original name : The Riverside. Not only does it connect the building back to it roots, to it's place in the hearts of the people of Boulder, but it also connotes a visual of calmness, coolness, a sense of movement, and a sense of discovery. We did not come to this name immediately but only after days and days of playing with other ideas. In the end though, what calls all of us to this building is the soul of what is already there  - our job is not to force it into something new, but let it shine through with as little pomp & ego as possible. Thus we come to giving the building back to it's original name : The Riverside.</p>

			<p>Moodboards convey a sense of tone through imagery, color & brand examples. Before creating visual branding we begin with moodboards to capture the essence of the brand and convert that into a visual language. This also helps define a sense which visual direction speaks most to the brand and the target audiences. <a href = "riverside/moodboards.pdf" target = "blank">okay give them to me</a></p>
